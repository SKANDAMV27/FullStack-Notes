*   Abstrucation is an one of the principal under the object oriented programming language.
*   Abstructaion in java it is a process of hiding the internal implementation details of funcationality and showing only the essentational funcational to the user.
*   Abstrucation can be achived by the two ways
    *   abstract class(it is an 100% abstrucation)
        *   we declear the abstract class with the abstract key.
        *   abstract method (without a body) and normal method having a body
        *   subclasses can implements the abstract methods from the abstract class.
     * Interface(It is an 100% abstraction)
        *   A class can implement multiple interfaces.
        *   An Interface can have only the abstract method(Without Body).
        *   An Interface cannot have Constructor,because they cannot be initiated directly.
