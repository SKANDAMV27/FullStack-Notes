*   Polymorphism is an one of the Principal in object oriented programming language.
*   Polymorphism means " many form" in java allows same method or object but the behavior is different based on the object that invokes.
*   Having Same Name but Different Forms.

*   It have Two Type of Polymorphism

    * Compile-Time Polymorphism
    * Run-Time Polymorphism

    * Compile-Time Polymorphism :
        Method Behavior is determined during compail Time.
        It is an Method Overloading.
        It having same Method but different parameter.
        *   overloading is an compile-Time polymorphism.
        *   overloading in a java with the multiple class having same name but different parameter.
        Rules of overloading
        *   Method name should be same.
        *   Method having the different parameter.
        *   can have different access modifier.
        *   can throw the different exception.



    * Run-Time Polymorphism:
        Method Behavior is determinde during Run Time.
        It is an Method overriding.
        Subclass provide the special implimination of method that alredy defined in Superclass.
        *   overriding is an Run-Time Polymorphism.
        *   overriding in java means redefining the method from the super class to the sub class having the same method name,parameter and the return type so child class can also create a own implementation.

        Rules of the overriding
        *   method name should be same.
        *   having same parameter and the return type.
        *   cannot override the static,final and private method.
